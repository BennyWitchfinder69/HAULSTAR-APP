/* -------------------------------------------------------
   HAULSTAR: TRUCKER PATH INTEGRATION STRATEGY (2 OPTIONS)
   -------------------------------------------------------
   Purpose: Use Trucker Path features within HaulStar app
------------------------------------------------------- */

/* 
OPTION 1: DEEP LINKING TRUCKER PATH FEATURES
----------------------------------------------
Use hyperlinks or buttons that launch Trucker Path tools
inside the user's browser or app. No data sharing needed.
*/

<!-- Example: Button to open Trucker Path Truck Stops page -->
<a href="https://truckerpath.com/truck-stops/" target="_blank">
  <button style="
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #D4AF37;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 6px;
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
  ">
    üõ£Ô∏è Open Trucker Path Truck Stops
  </button>
</a>

<!-- Can also link to:
     - https://truckerpath.com/fuel/
     - https://truckerpath.com/parking/
     - https://truckerpath.com/weigh-stations/
-->

/*
ADVANTAGES:
- Fast to deploy
- Keeps users in HaulStar ecosystem
- No API or legal issues

LIMITATIONS:
- Opens in new window/tab
- No direct data pulled into your dashboard
*/

/* 
OPTION 2: PARTNERSHIP / DATA INTEGRATION (LONG GAME)
------------------------------------------------------
Contact Trucker Path for commercial access or integration.
This allows you to:
- Pull in truck stop data
- Show live parking info
- Access fuel prices
- Embed weigh station statuses
*/

üìß Suggested outreach plan:
1. Go to: https://truckerpath.com/contact/
2. Reach out via business inquiry
3. Ask for white-labeled API or data feed access
4. Pitch use case:
   - You're building HaulStar, a fleet-focused logistics dashboard
   - You want to integrate Trucker Path tools into your driver workflow

üß† Backup Plan:
If they decline API access, use:
- **OpenStreetMap** for routing + road data
- **Mapbox** for custom truck routes (avoid height/weight restricted roads)
- **Pilot Flying J Developer API** (fuel & amenities)
- **Love‚Äôs API / Partner Program** for truck stops and live parking

/* 
RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:
- Short-term: Use Option 1 (Deep Link Buttons)
- Long-term: Pursue Option 2 (Partnership/API Access)
*/

/* -------------------------------------------------------
   Google Maps has been excluded (not viable for trucking).
   This version is truck-optimized only.
